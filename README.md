# StreetsAI

AI-powered street analysis and optimization system built with TypeScript.

## About

This project is inspired by and follows the tutorial series by [Radu Mariescu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_C7L7zelz8&list=PLB0Tybl0UNfYoJE7ZwsBQoDIG4YN9ptyY&index=12), but implemented entirely in **TypeScript** instead of the original language used in the tutorial.

## Features

- Street analysis using AI algorithms
- Real-time optimization
- Modern TypeScript implementation
- Fast development with Vite
- [Add other features as you develop them]

## Technology Stack

- **TypeScript** - Main programming language
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server (perfect for TS/HTML/CSS projects)
- **HTML/CSS** - Frontend structure and styling
- [Add other technologies as you implement them]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16.0 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StreetsAI.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd StreetsAI

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server with Vite
npm run dev
```

### Build for Production

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Preview the production build
npm run preview
```

## Why Vite?

Vite is an excellent choice for this TypeScript project because:

- **Fast HMR** (Hot Module Replacement) for rapid development
- **Native TypeScript support** without additional configuration
- **Optimized builds** with Rollup under the hood
- **Modern ES modules** support
- **Lightning-fast development server**
